    <p>There are several other similar services, what makes <strong>unavailable.it</strong> unique?</p>
    <div class="list">
        <i
                class="fa block expandable"
                ng-class="{'fa-chevron-right': !encryptedAtRest, 'fa-chevron-down': encryptedAtRest}"
                ng-click="encryptedAtRest=!encryptedAtRest">
            Messages are encrypted at rest.
            <div class="expanded-div" ng-if="encryptedAtRest">
                <p>
                    Unread messages are encrypted in the database using part of the URL as the deryption key.
                    This means that if anybody gains access to our database, whether through hacking, legal supoena, or
                    careless code, then your message is still unavailable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is in contrast to systems that are encrypted only in transit.  These systems will store your
                    messagein plain text and only encrypt them while they're being transmitted to the desired recipient.
                    This means that anybody that gains access to the database can read every saved message.  This
                    doubly sucks if read messages aren't purged like they are at unavailable.it.

                    Don't trust us with your data?  You shouldn't.  That's why this site is completely open source
                    including Dockerfiles and build files.  All you need is a computer that can serve HTTP
                    and you can run this site on your own.

                    The endgame is to have a paid service which allows unthrottled message sending.  In hopes to
                    prevent spam, users are currently only allowed one message per minute.  But for now, and for
                    the foreseeable future, this site is free.

                <p>
                    We'll start talking paid services once we need more than a t2.micro.
